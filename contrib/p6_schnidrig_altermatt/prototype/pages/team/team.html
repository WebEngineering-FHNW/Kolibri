      <p>The Kolibri project is developed and maintained by a team of dedicated developers and contributors. Here are some of the key members of our team:</p>
      <h2>Advisors and Experts</h2>

      <p>The Kolibri project is mainly developed by Prof. Dierk Koenig and his students. Prof. Koenig is responsible for integrating student contributions into the official project and overseeing its development. The project also benefits from the valuable input and guidance of Mr. Fabian Affolter, a UI/UX and design advisor with extensive experience in the industry.</p>

      <p>In addition to the students and Mr. Affolter, the project benefits from the contributions of additional advisors and industry experts. These advisors are renowned professionals in their respective fields and contribute their expertise to ensure that the Kolibri toolkit remains cutting-edge and relevant to industry needs.</p>

      <p>Their contributions help ensure that Kolibri stays true to its mission of providing a lightweight, dependency-free toolkit for building web UIs with vanilla JavaScript. The collaborative and community-driven approach of the project means that everyone can contribute to the project's growth and success.</p>

      <p>We are proud of the diverse and talented team of contributors that have helped make Kolibri what it is today, and we welcome anyone who wants to join us in shaping its future.</p>

      <h2>Kolibri student contributors</h2>
      <p>Many of the contributions to the Kolibri project are made by students who work on the project as part of their coursework or as independent projects. These students are mentored and supervised by Prof. Koenig and other senior members of the team, and their contributions are critical to the success and growth of the project.</p>

      <p> Kolibri aims to be a sustainable, high-quality toolkit.
        Contributions are validated through usability testing
        and automated tests.
        Industry experts and academic advisers assess the code quality
        and the completeness of the documentation.
        Every contribution must have proven its worth in an application.
